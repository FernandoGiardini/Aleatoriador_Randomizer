# Aleatoriador_Randomizer
Random value generator developed in Android with kotlin and Jetpack Compose, testing some Compose features.

>> The objective of this project is to practice and wrap up some basic concepts of Jetpack Compose in android development, such as defining UI with functions annotaded with '@Composable',
using logic in the UI file, and componentize UI elements for reutilization and eliminate boiler plate code.

This project is also part of a goal of developing small scale apps for better understanding of all android uses and capacities.
